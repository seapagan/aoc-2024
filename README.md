# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code
2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.

I recommend every coder tries to participate in this event (even when it's #out
of season as the site stays up all year). It's a great way to learn new things
and have fun. I'm not a competitive programmer, but I enjoy solving these
puzzles. I'm not trying to solve them as fast as I can, but I'm trying to solve
them as clean as I can. I'm also trying to learn new things while solving them,
which I definitely have.

Solutions are in Python.

> These solutions may use global variables and other bad practices I
> wouldn't use in production code, but that works for AOC :grin: I have tried to
> keep them clean and as efficient as I can with my current low knowledge of
> standard algorithms. Maybe I'll revisit them in the future to improve them.
